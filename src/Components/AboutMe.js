            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style={{color: "black"}} className='justify'>I, Venkata Suresh Yarva, have committed myself to mastering software engineering and web development. With a solid foundation in software test automation engineering, I have evolved into a full-stack developer, specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies. My expertise lies in crafting interactive user interfaces (UIs) with React, managing component states, and enhancing performance for smooth user experiences. Additionally, I have developed secure and efficient back-end services using Django Rest Framework, including the creation of RESTful APIs, implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integration of databases to maintain data integrity and security.
                <br></br><br></br>
                My journey has been enriched by gaining practical experience in Agile methodologies, version control with Git, and team collaboration. As a graduate student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the University of Florida, I have developed innovative solutions that address real-world problems, demonstrating my capability to solve complex issues. Professionally, I served as a Junior Software Test Automation Engineer at EPAM Systems, where I played a key role in integrating Mada and Rupay cards and spearheaded the migration of NPCI services. My research contributions have resulted in a published IEEE paper on transforming AutoCAD plots into G-code, underscoring my dedication to technological advancement and excellence.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I am eager to apply my full-stack development skills to new endeavors and projects. Feel free to visit my portfolio to view some of my latest work and contact me if you're interested in discussing potential partnerships or job opportunities.</p>
