        "projectDescription": "'Crime Data Analysis for Safer Communities' is a comprehensive analysis focusing on crime trends spanning the past two decades, with a specific emphasis on seasonal variations in crime occurrences and their temporal and spatial distribution. Utilizing sophisticated computational methods, the project aims to establish long-term crime means rather than solely focusing on seasonal fluctuations. It serves as a valuable tool for users to assess crime patterns within specific locations over extended periods, enabling comparisons of safety levels. By examining serious crimes through the lens of IUCR codes, the project tracks their progression and aids in anticipating potential increases in crime rates, contributing to informed decision-making for proactive crime prevention efforts.",

        "projectDescription": "Developed and analyzed the vulnerability of DeepISP, a deep learning-based Image Signal Processing (ISP) model,to patch-based adversarial attacks. Utilized the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to evaluate image reconstruction and object detection using YOLOv8. Demonstrated successful object misclassification and reduced average object detection rate from 88% to 53%. Highlighted the critical need for robust defense mechanisms to secure deep learning-based ISPs in practical applications.",

Implemented various models, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and evaluated their performance using F1 score and ROC-AUC score. The best-performing model was the Random Forest classifier, which achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.80 and an F1 score of 0.72, surpassing the minimum baseline and indicating the effectiveness of the model",
