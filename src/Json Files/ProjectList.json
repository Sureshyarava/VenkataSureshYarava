        "projectDescription": "'Crime Data Analysis for Safer Communities' is a comprehensive analysis focusing on crime trends spanning the past two decades, with a specific emphasis on seasonal variations in crime occurrences and their temporal and spatial distribution. Utilizing sophisticated computational methods, the project aims to establish long-term crime means rather than solely focusing on seasonal fluctuations. It serves as a valuable tool for users to assess crime patterns within specific locations over extended periods, enabling comparisons of safety levels. By examining serious crimes through the lens of IUCR codes, the project tracks their progression and aids in anticipating potential increases in crime rates, contributing to informed decision-making for proactive crime prevention efforts.",
