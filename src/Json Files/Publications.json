    "description": "Numeric Controls are common today for the automated control of machining tools. High speed computer is used as an interface to implement such controls. This study aims to generate a G-code, directly from a drawing, AutoCAD, file and upload the same as a compatible G-Code for the NC Machine. This paper details the approach (concepts) and describes various steps involved in implementation from data extraction to transformation of data to G-Code.",
